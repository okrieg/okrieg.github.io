	  What is this project about?
	  </h3>
<p>
OpenDaylight (ODL) [1] is an open platform for network
programmability to enable software defined networking (SDN) for
networks at any size and scale. ODL is supported by a large number of
major vendors (Brocade, Cisco, Citrix, Dell, HP, IBM, Intel, …).
The ODL and OpenStack Neutron teams have collaborated to integrate
the two projects such that ODL can provide virtual tenant networking
for OpenStack tenants, as a plug-in for OpenStack Neutron. But, ODL
applies beyond SDN, notably, to the new and vast world of the
“Internet of Things” (IoT).</p>

<p> There is a dearth of IoT [2, 3]
applications supporting large-scale “multi-thing”
IoT networks (Multi-Thing is loosely defined as a network composed of IoT components of different sizes, shape and scale). The requirement for this project is to design and
prototype two or more IoT applications running over the ODL IoT data
store, supporting a large-scale multi-thing network.</p>
<p>It is envisioned
that the development team will have some degree of latitude in
creating the prototype applications. The context is smart cities [4].
Imagine you can embed any sort of sensor, camera, data acquisition
devices, whatever throughout a city. How would you help the
population of this city to have a better life? Do a little research
and you will find many ways to extract data from your environment and
reuse it in a beneficial way.
</p>
<p>ODL is being used as
an IoT data collection platform [5]. The IoT data is organized in a
massive resource tree (potentially millions of nodes). This tree
contains measurements from devices (the things) and its associated
attributes.  The attributes represent metadata about the resource,
for example access rights, creation time, children list, owner, size,
quota etc.</p>
<p>The goal of this
project is to create at least 2 unrelated, smart cities IoT
applications, which will use different type of “things” to gather
data and send it to our IoT collection facility. Once there, the data
must be extracted using oneM2M (an IoT standard) APIs and processed
using the reasoning tool of your choice. The result must be presented
on a smart phone.</p>

		Deliverables
        </h3>

            <ul>
		<li> Smart devices
	(you may use raspberry Pie, Arduinos, etc.)  which are capable of
	collecting data and send it to our ODL data store using oneM2M APIs
		<li>A reasoner:
	a software module in Java running within or on top of ODL, capable of
	extracting IoT data from the ODL data store (or a back-end database),
	and process it to produce the solution of the problem. You may use
	an off the shelve SW or write your own logic for the problem you’re
	trying to solve. Even better, reuse what has already been developed
	at MIT (AIs etc.)
		<li> A rendering
	engine which takes the output of the reasoner and makes it available
	to be consumed by a client IoT application
		<li> A mobile app
	or a way to display the output of the reasoner by accessing a URL
	located on the ODL server.
		<li> You must be
	able to show the two or more apps with a reasonable amount of
	hardware (i.e., you don’t need to have a city bus or a 20 foot
	high  traffic light to make the demo!)
            </ul>
