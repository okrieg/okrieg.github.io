          Course Outline
        </h3>

            <p>The course will combine group reading and discussion of influential publications in cloud computing, some lectures by instructor and by invited speakers, independent review of talks coupled with classroom discussion, and a large project.</p>

            <p>For the most part, the course will be flipped, with most of the material independently studied, and then group discussion of the material.</p>

            <p>The project will be done by teams of 3 to 5 students
            working with a mentor; depending on the project an
            industry leader and/or developer with a relavent project,
            or a senior graduate student or a postdoc working on a
            relavent research project. It will exploit the <a
             href="http://www.bu.edu/hic/research/massachusetts-open-cloud/">MOC</a>
            as well as industry clouds (Amazon AWS, Microsoft AWS, Rackspace, ...)</p>


            <p>Course will give students:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> understanding of cloud computing at the IaaS level in general, and open stack in particular
            <li> an understanding of key Big Data platforms
            <li> understanding and experience with working as part of an agile team, with experience in running and participating in  scrums, planning sessions, ...
            <li> extensive experience with github, agile tools, and
            various technologies specific to the projects students
            take on
            <li> an artifact that they will have developed that, if successful, will be part of  a broader initiative
</p>
            </ul>

<h3>
<a name="prereq" class="anchor" href="#prereq"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites
</h3>
<p>This course assumes students have a strong programming background.
       You will have substantial problems completing the projects if
      you don't have signficant programming experience, and we
      strongly suggest that you avoid this course, or at least come
      talk to the instructors if you have any concerns.<p>

<p><strong>For BU EC students/grads:</strong> Undergrads must have taken EC327 or equivalent and preferably another software course, EC330 or EC440, before taking this course. Graduate students must have taken a rigorous programming class recently, such as EC504 or equivalent (or have major software design experience in industry).  <p>
<p><strong>For BU CS students/grads:</strong> This course assumes students have a strong programming background. Undergrads must have taken CS350 Operating Systems (preferably CS552 as well), CS 460 Database Systems (preferably CS562 as well), and CS 455 Computer Networks (preferably but not must) courses. Graduate students must have taken a rigorous programming class recently, (or have major software design experience).  <p>
<p><strong>For Northeastern students:</strong> This course assumes students have a strong programming background. In particular, MS students should have taken CS 5010, PDP. Industrial programming experience will be helpful, but is not required.  <p>
<h3>
<a name="workload" class="anchor" href="#workload"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workload
</h3>

<p>Each week we will be covering on average two research papers and one practitioner paper or other teaching material. You will be expected to read, review and discuss. These papers will likely require that you find and read additional material as necessary to ensure your comprehension. Do not underestimate the amount of work this can be. You will be required to submit a written review of the papers prior to class. You will also be expected to actively participate in the in class discussion. Each student is expected to lead one more of the class discussions by summarizing the paper and seeding discussions with questions and observations based on the paper.</p>

<h3>
<a name="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects
</h3>


<p>In addition, to the weekly papers, there will be a major project. This
will be teams of 3 to 5 students, starting from the course beginning, with a
mentor, from industry, senior graduate student, or one of the instructors.

<p>The project is due by the end of the exam week.
The project presentations will be given in the form of a final poster and a demo.
There will also be demos scheduled throughout the course to demonstrate regular progress.</p>

<p>This syllabus is changing as the course progresses, so please check back frequently to see what we will cover next.</p>

<!-- If you want to see the original syllabus, please look <a href="index-orig.html#syllabus">here</a>. -->


<p>The first two weeks we will do course intro, agile methods, and project
  pitches, as well as some paper reviews. After that. each week we will cover
  two papers or talks on cloud computing, one discussion topic on agile development or have a speaker about a recent cloud technology, and spend one hour on demos from a subset of the projects. Project teams will be expected to give a demo every second week. </p>
<!-- Do we want the better spark paper? -->
