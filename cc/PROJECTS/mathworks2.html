          <p>As uses for the cloud continue to evolve, so does the idea of connecting not only people, but things. The objects around us continue to get smarter, are able to communicate with each other and central data servers, and are able to gather data in quantities previously unheard of. One of the greatest benefits of this proliferation of data is the ability to proactively analyze both the components and systems we have built to learn how to improve them. For this project, you will leverage the open source version of ThingSpeak â€“ the open data platform for the Internet of Things. You will build an enhancement into the ThingSpeak application (such as a system for more robust visualizations or a way to easily manage devices). You will deploy an appropriately sized instance of ThingSpeak (including web, API, and database servers) to gather data from sensors that you have deployed.  Once a representative set of data has been collected, you will use a mathematical computing language (such as R, MATLAB, or Python) to connect to ThingSpeak, extract your data, and perform analysis on it to learn about the efficiency of the system you have instrumented. You will then make recommendations to improve the system. As an example, you may choose to place temperature and light sensors inside of buildings or rooms on your campus, gather data over the course of multiple days, and then look for inefficiencies, or waste, in the system and make recommendations to improve it.</p>

            <p>The project is fairly open-ended and the skills below are recommended, but being familiar with several of these tools and languages would definitely be helpful.</p>
