By using a modular approach with a broad library of software and security components - application, utilities, data sets, lock downs, configurations, etc - users can automate the entire lifecycle of their environments. Users leverage this library of resources to automate the execution and securing anythoing from simple workstations to complex environments (e.g 30 or more servers). Every thing in the library can be shared and reused "as is" and/or used as the basis for something more. </p>    <p>Working with a set of experienced asset developers, the team will identify options for services and applications that impact the the user community. After evaluating alternatives, the team will select a target stack in the area of enterprise service and/or cyber security tools. Then the team will develop, integrate, test and secure the assets and system designs to make it real. The resulting assets and designs will be shared and used across the CONS3RT community in multiple sites, including the MOC.</p>     <h3><a name="background" class="what-is"> </a>    <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/kq3mlew8bqoslmh/maestro_500.jpg" width="50" height="50"> What is CONS3RT?    </h3>    <p><a href="https://www.cons3rt.com">CONS3RT</a> is a leading-edge cloud and security orchestration service providing users with DevOps Automation and Validation.
