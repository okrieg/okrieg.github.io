Project Overview: </h3>

<p>Analyze the kubernetes controller framework that is
implemented in the scheduler, build tests which can rapidly simulate how it
interacts with etcd in a large cluster, and use those tests to determine if
algorithmic improvements (i.e. bloom filters) can be used to speed up
matching of pods -> nodes in a busy cluster.</p>

<p>Chance to deeply learn about scheduling, golang, kubernetes, etcd, consistency algorithms,the RAFT algorithm, bloom filters, and database n-ary indices.
High profile pull requests into at least 3 projects will be possible: etcd,
kubernetes, and  willf's bloom filter.</p>

<p>0) Build scheduling stress tests inside of kubernetes unit testing library
which measure the time to schedule 1000s of pods when node matching needs
to occur using complex inequality/predicate logic (i.e. memory, cpu
constraints, etc.).  This is mostly kubernetes coding activity.</p>

<p>1) Research: a bloom filter with inequalities, e.g.
<a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/alenex2006.pdf">this</a> .  Can it
be used in the real world, when and when not?   Implement it as an
extension to https://github.com/willf/bloom .  This is pure algorithmic
research.</p>

<p>2) Analyze how the controller interacts with etcd, diagram it, and
determine what happens when inequalities (less than, greater than) are
queried.  Look at the Matches interface and how it is triggered from the
current scheduler.  This is mostly pure golang+kube research: Diagramming
and looking at the code path.</p>

<p>3) Analyze ETCD (this is the backbone of kubernetes: the golang equivalent
of zookeeper: a k/v database that is strictly consistent) and determine how
one can efficiently query inequalities in etcd.  How range queries
currently supported in ETCD, if so, how are they implemented, and could
they be sped up? (e.g. <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9e39/0f82217acede629306eb0b45e040152b2775.pdf">this </a>)
.
Also, in general, how are range queries implemented in other K/V databases
(SOLR, Cassandra,...).</p>

<p>4) Find where the kubernetes API uses ETCD, intercept all calls: What parts
of etcd's API is it using/not-using.  This can be done using anything from
Wireshark just look at HTTP calls being made - to just reading
through-analyzing of the code.  Make a meaningfull histogram of etcd calls
being made in a real world application (i.e. running density tests, or
running other e2e tests).</p>

<p>Overall goal: Determine wether or not (1) can be used to optimize the
performance of queries inside of (2).   Measure the difference using the
results of (0).  (3 and 4 play into this because they will allow us to know
if we're on the right path for 1 and 2, or wether we should change
direction).</p>
