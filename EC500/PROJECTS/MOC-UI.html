	  What is the MOC-UI?
	  </h3>
	  <p> The MOC-UI is the front end GUI for tenants of the Massachusetts Open
          Cloud (<a
          href="http://www.bu.edu/hic/initiatives/massachusetts-open-cloud/">MOC</a>).
          We expect it to be used by students from BU, NU, MIT, HU and
          UMass, as well as some users from the broader commonwealth. It
	  differs from the existing Horizon UI of OpenStack in that
          it: 1) needs to operate across multiple deployments (HU, NU,
          BU...), 2) has to expose a complex marketplace of services
          to meet the goals of the MOC (e.g., more like Amazon's consumer
          marketplace), and 3) presents a simpler (but hopefully more
          compelling) interface for 
          end-users (Horizon supports both users and providers of the cloud). </p>

	  <p>While there is infinite number of projects to
          extend the initial student projects that has developed it, a few samples include: 
          <ul>
            <li> spin off per-tenant UI for performance and security isolation
            <li> add other services, e.g., Trove, Heat
	    <li> add networking diagram to the GUI
          </ul> </p>
