          What is the HaaS?
	  </h3>
	  <p>
	    We're developing <a href="https://github.com/CCI-MOC/haas">Hardware
		    as a Service</a> to be a new fundamental layer in cloud
	    datacenters.  In a HaaS-enabled datacenter, researchers and
	    developers can independently stand up services on bare hardware,
	    with guaranteed isolation between them.  They can scale their
	    deployments by allocating and freeing hardware nodes, without
	    having to change any physical setup of the datacenter. HaaS allows
	    bare metal machines to be used similarly to virtual machines in the
	    cloud.
          </p>

        <h3><a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span
          class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
          Why do we need Recursive HaaS?
	  </h3>

	  <p>
            After allocating new nodes, software must be deployed onto them.
	    Currently, the best deployment options we have involve PXE-booting
	    the nodes into an install image, which can take a while. Just the BIOS POST, the
	    first part of this process, can take 5 or 10 minutes.  A faster deployment
	    method is key to users scaling their application up more rapidly.
          </p>

	  <p> While it is not acceptable for a general environment, users that
	  have some level of trust with each other could use <a
	  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec</a> to move from a
  running Linux kernel to a pre-boot environment without going through a full
  hardware reboot.  As long as different users of the HaaS agree to leave
  machines in a state that is ready to kexec, then this could be used to
  quickly deploy to machines allocated with the HaaS. This could allow
  massively parallel jobs to run for 10 or 20 seconds across thousands of nodes
  to quickly accomplish tasks like high resolution rendering or other realtime
  tasks. </p>

	  <p>
	  Since HaaS is a small, trusted layer in the data center that is used
	  for both production and research purposes, HaaS needs to be remain
		  stable. Thus, new features need to be well tested before they
			  can be rolled out, simliar to the philosophy of <a
				  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux">Redhat
			  Enterprise Linux (RHEL)</a>. Rather than immediately
		  merging freshly developed functionality like fast
		  provisioning into the stable data center HaaS layer, it would
		  make more sense to have another HaaS into which these changes
		  could be made, similar to how <a
		  href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> is the more up to
	  date version of RHEL. It's with this in mind that the other major
	  part of this project, <b>Recursive HaaS</b> comes into play.
	  </p>

	    <p>
	    Users or groups of users could run their own HaaS on top of the datacenter's base HaaS:
	    the derived HaaS's nodes would be allocated from base HaaS's nodes,
	    the derived HaaS's networks would be set up by the base HaaS, and
	    so forth.  But users of the derived HaaS would have an agreement
	    with each other that users of the base HaaS do not have: When
	    freeing nodes, they will be left in a state ready to be kexec'd.
	    This allows users of the derived HaaS to scale up their deployments
	    much more quickly.

	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Fast provisioning is just an example of recursive HaaS.
	  There are a number of interesting research projects that we
	  see a recursive HaaS implementation enabling.

          Possible Goals
        </h3>
	  <p>
          <ul>
	    <li> Develop a simple pass-through recursive HaaS
          implementation.
	    <li> Add kexec support, and build a pre-boot environment
          that can be provisioned against.  For the pre-boot environment:
              <ul>
                <li> Research existing pre-boot environments
                <li> Try different policies for entering the pre-boot
                environment (whether the user or the HaaS does this; what kind
                of checking is done by the HaaS or a HaaS administrator)
                <li> Find a way to communicate the new OS to the pre-boot
                environment
                <li> Perhaps investigate broadcast communication methods, to
                speed up provisioning many nodes at once
                <li> Could the pre-boot environment be skipped?  Perhaps kexec
                directly from the old OS to the new
              </ul>
	    <li> Demonstrate a piece of software scaling up through kexec
	    <li> Measure performance of the kexec method, compared to a cold boot
	    <li> Characterize level of trust needed between users---potentially
	    even prototype some possible attacks
            <li> Investigate allocating additional nodes to the derived HaaS
            on demand
	    <li> Study alternatives to kexec
          </ul> </p>
