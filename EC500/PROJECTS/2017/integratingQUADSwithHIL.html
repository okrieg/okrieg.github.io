Project Overview:

	  </h3>
<p>QUADS stands for quick and dirty scheduler, an opensource project developed
at Red Hat that tracks system and network resource allocations, schedules those
resources, and provisions those resources as requested, all to meet v various
policies. It uses date/time based YAML schedule for resource allocations and has
support for automated visualization of current and future allocations.</p>

<p>HIL, which stands for Hardware Isolation Layer, is a minimalistic layer that
decouples node allocation from node provisioning. It allows mutually untrusting
physically deployed services to share the data center while resources can move
back and forth between them.</p>

<p>QUADS is independent of the underlying provisioning system and HIL does not
put restrictions on how the nodes are scheduled. In this project, you will
integrate the two sub-systems where QUADS will schedule resources allocated
using HIL.</p>

<p>You will learn in depth about scheduling, provisioning, and complexity of
integrating existing systems to create a new solution with a chance to get
your pull requests integrated into QUADS and HIL. You will analyze and make
modifications to the code-base of both of these projects. If needed, you will
develop new API calls and UIs. This will include a full cycle of development
experience from proposing the design, implementation and unit testing, to
writing documentation for users and developers. </p>
