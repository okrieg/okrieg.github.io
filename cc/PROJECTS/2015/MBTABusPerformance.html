          <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

          <p>Work collaboratively with MBTA staff to:
            <ul>
              <li> use MBTA data sets to explore mass transit use in Greater Boston and
              <li> identify patterns, insights, and/or new uses for data that can support enhanced MBTA service-delivery.
            </ul>

          <p>Specifically, you will
            <ul>
              <li> ingest a data set containing real time vehicle location data from the MBTA and
              <li>  analyze it to understand the impact of a recent change in vehicle routing on service delivery.
            </ul>


        <h3>
          <a id="problem" class="anchor" href="#problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem</h3>

        <p>Use MBTA-provided data to generate a comparison of on-time bus performance before and after the implementation of significant MBTA service changes that went into effect over the course of spring and summer 2013 (specific dates, by route, are available).</p>


<h3>
  <a id="tiers" class="anchor" href="#tiers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Tiers</h3>

  <p>The project will use a combination of SmartBusMart and other tools to read the data set, extract information relevant to the performance metrics used by the MBTA, and to compute the metrics for the time periods surrounding the service change. (MBTA’s reporting database, SmartBusMart, has the ability to ingest and analyze time-series data.) </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Ingestion tier – Pulls information from the data set into a data store for analysis
            <li> Processing tier - reads data from the data store and computes performance metrics
              <ul>
                <li> MBTA’s on-time performance standard is defined in a public policy document - the <a href="https://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/About_the_T/T_Projects/T_Projects_List/2010ServiceDeliveryPolicy.pdf">MBTA Service Delivery Policy</a>
              </ul>
          </ul>

      <a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>
      <p>Several years ago, the MBTA started a project to install the now-familiar signs that tell travelers when the next bus, or train will be arriving. During the early stages of the project, the MBTA also made the real-time vehicle information available to smartphone app developers, posting a set of public data feeds and running an app development contest.  As a result, Boston became the first city in the nation with a set of smartphone apps providing an instant look at real time bus and train arrival updates.</p>

      <p>From this project, the MBTA has accumulated several years of data showing the minute-by-minute position of dozens of buses and trains, along with traffic congestion measures, service alerts, weather data, and other pertinent information.   Project participants are confident that the data holds the answers to some important questions about how to make mass transit in Greater Boston more efficient and convenient. This project is your chance to help the MBTA find out.</p>

    </p>During the course of the project, you will work with mentors from the MBTA and the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative to identify questions to answer using the data, assemble the information and tools needed to come up with answers, and perform the analysis.</p>
