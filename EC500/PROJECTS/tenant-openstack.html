          The Massachusetts Open Cloud
	</h3>

	  <p>
            Currently, cloud providers, such as Amazon and Rackspace, offer
            all of their cloud services themselves: compute (VMs), virtual
            disks, data storage, networking, and so on.  Users are therefore
            locked in to one solution---they cannot combine data storage from
            Rackspace with compute from Amazon.
          </p>

	  <p>
            The Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC) is trying to create an
            environment where multiple cloud service providers offer different
            services, and users can combine different provider's services at
            their choice.
          </p>

        <h3><a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span
          class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
          Openstack Resellers
	</h3>

	  <p>
            Openstack services, such as Nova, Cinder, and Swift, are run by a
            resource provider (the group running and maintaining the Openstack
            installation), and used by a resource consumer (tenants in the
            Openstack installation).  There is only two different economic
            roles in this system: the buyer and the seller.
          </p>

          <p>
            For more complex systems, such as in the MOC, organizations may want to act as
            resellers: buying a resource, somehow repackaging it conveniently,
            and then selling it again.  In an Openstack environment, this can
            be accomplished by running an Openstack service which itself gets
            its resources from other Openstack services.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this project we will demonstrate one particular version of
            this: per-tenant pass-through openstack services.  When you create
            or allocate an object in one of these services, it will pass the
            request to an underlying service, thereby creating or allocating
            the object there.
          </p>

        <h3><a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span
          class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
          Extensions
	</h3>

          <p>
            At first, the pass-through implementations will be hard-coded for
            simplicity to use one particular underlying service.  The next
            step is to use the MOC Service Directory to discover the relevant
            services, and allow the user to select some (possibly restricted)
            combination of them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another related project is the MOC client library.  It is designed
            to be a general API for cloud applications intended to run in the
            MOC.  It would abstract over different backends, by letting the
            user choose which services to use, but then have the user interact
            with those different options in one uniform way.  This project is
            related, in that it achieves some of the same goals, but without
            forcing users to modify their cloud services.  So, another goal is
            to make a version of the Openstack pass-through services that is
            based on the MOC client library.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, for using these pass-through services to be convenient,
            there should be a way to deploy these pass-through services in an
            automated fashion, possibly using Heat.  (The MOC client library
            has this goal as well, and some work could be shared there.)

          Possible Goals
        </h3>
	  <p>
          <ul>
	    <li> Write a pass-through implementation for some of the Openstack
	      services (most likely Nova)
              <ul>
                <li> Decide how to manage authorization and
                authentication---use the underlying layer's identity services,
                  or build new ones
                <li> One-to-one or many-to-one?
                <li> In the many-to-one situation, does there need to be
                metadata for which underlying service to go to?  Do Openstack
                APIs need to be modified?
              </ul>
            <li> Multiple backends
              <ul>
                <li> Discovering backends in the MOC service directory
                <li> Establishing a way to select particular backends
              </ul>
            <li> Integration with MOC client library
            <li> Automated deployment of pass-through services
          </ul> </p>
