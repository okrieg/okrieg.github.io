      <p>One of the issues organizations face today when implementing DevOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, is that it is difficult to provide a consistent environment from development through to quality assurance and production environments. The goal of this project is to build an environment where a developer can in an automatic way deploy and test their code in a cloud, or even on a laptop, and then automatically deploy it into their production environment.  If successful, the result would be an open source package that would be used by thousands of developers on a daily basis working on new applications hosted in the cloud. The portable environment will make such an application deployable in any Open Hybrid Cloud</p>

            <ul>
              <li> Virtualization: Vagrant,  KVM, libvirt (Valuable)
                <li> Linux - bash (Very important)
                  <li> Python(Very important)
