        Enterprises can afford solutions for recovery from disasters.
        Small businesses suffer from the same issues, mostly in a smaller scale.
        Most small businesses cannot afford enterprise grade recovery solutions.
        The cloud provides the ability to generate cost effective business continuity.

        The goal of this project is to produce an automated method of recovering a
        Windows server in an AWS EC2 instance from a backup generated from that server
        that is stored in AWS S3.
        There also needs to be a VPN connection from the EC2 instance to the local client
        of the server.

	  What is Business Continuity?
	</h3>
	  <p>
          Wikipedia says:
	  Business continuity encompasses a loosely defined set of
	  planning, preparatory and related activities which are
	  intended to ensure that an organization's critical business
	  functions will either continue to operate despite serious
	  incidents or disasters that might otherwise have interrupted
	  them, or will be recovered to an operational state within
	  a reasonably short period.
	  </p>
	  <p>
          Generally it means making sure a company can keep doing business
          in the face of disasters, but also in the case of smaller problems
          like disk failures.
          </p>
