          Problem
        </h3>

	  <p> OpenDaylight (ODL) has emerged as one of the leading
	  Software-Defined Network controllers. It is supported by a large
	  number of major vendors (Brocade, Cisco, Citrix, Dell, HP, IBM, Intel,
	  â€¦). This platform is gaining traction and now supports a variety of
	  applications including applications for network virtualization and
	  cloud (OpenStack). </p>

	  <p>
	  One key limitation in ODL today is the lack of modularity: many
	  important network applications do not play nicely together. Typically,
	  these ODL network applications assume full control over network
	  element configurations and hence do not compose well with other
	  applications.</p>

	  <p> Recent work in SDN provides network programming abstractions that
	  promise to make it possible to write applications in a modular way,
	  with components written independently and then combined at a semantic --
	  rather than configuration -- level. In particular, the <a
	   href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/comm282-voellmy.pdf">Maple
	  programming abstraction</a>, allows programs written in ordinary
	  programming language to be transparently deployed onto
	  high-performance switching hardware through a dynamic translation of
	  the program into the OpenFlow switch abstraction.</p>

	  <p> The goals of this project are to
	  <ul>
	    <li> Collaborate with a team at <a
	    href="http://www.cisco.com">Cisco Systems</a> and <a
	    href="http://cpsc.yale.edu">Yale University</a> to <a
	    href="https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Project_Proposals:Maple">bring
	   the Maple programming abstraction to the ODL controller platform</a>,
	    <li> port a significant network application, namely an
	   implementation of the OpenStack Neutron network service onto the
	   Maple service in ODL,
	    <li> evaluate various aspects of the
	   resulting system, and
	    <li> explore novel network services enabled by
	   integrating this programming abstraction into an OpenStack
	   system.
	  </ul>
