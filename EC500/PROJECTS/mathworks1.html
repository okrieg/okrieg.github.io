          <li>Mentor: Andrey Turovsky. email: andrey-at-jisto-dot-com</li>
          <li>Mentor trello id: @andrey120</li>
          <li>Mentor available times: Open to discussion with development team, but for now it'll be Thursdays from 2-4PM. I will generally be available in person (most likely at the MassChallenge office in the Seaport), but also by phone and via Skype.</li>
          <li>Min-max team size: 3-7</li>

          <li>Expected project hours per week (per team member): 5-8</li>
          <li>Will the project be open source? Initially no. Depending on where the project goes, there is some possibility of partially or fully open sourcing the project toward the end of the course, but initially team members would need to sign a confidentiality agreement. </li>

          <p>Disruptive innovation is already at work in higher education, and universities have to look no further than online classes to see examples of change at scale, said Clay Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor. One of the key components of online classes is the Assessment. All of the major learning management systems have some sort of online assessment component and analytics built on top of it. There is not much progress made on analytics for programming assignments. These online platforms are collecting lot of data about how a learner is solving programming assignments, but there is not much feedback provided neither to the learner not to the instructor based on that data. So focus of this project is to analyze programming assignment data per problem and highlight useful patterns with some visualization both for instructors and learners.</p>

            <p>The project is fairly open-ended and the skills below are recommended, but being familiar with several of these tools and languages would definitely be helpful.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Web framework: Ruby on Rails, nodejs, or any other web framework</li>

              <li>Node.js (optionally another scripting language - python, ruby, etc.)</li>
              <li>Visualization: Use of D3 or similar visualization library</li>
              <li>Microservices Architecture</li>
