        <p>Initializing secrets in cloud computing environments is a difficult problem. Often times
        developers and operations professionals end up just transmitting an initial secret in a way
        that it could be intercepted by the provider. Lincoln has worked to understand Xen's
        Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) implementation, and written software to interact 
        with the vTPM to address this problem.</p>
        <p>This project's goal is to take this research and integrate it into OpenStack. This 
        entails modifying Nova, OpenStack's compute resource scheduler, to spawn a vTPM instance 
        on the same host as an actual cloud instance is started on and registering that with the 
        vTPM manager on the host. We would expect that appropriate unit tests, 
        <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints">specs/blueprints</a> and operator 
        documentation would be put together as well.</p>
        <p>Indeed, this is a lot of work. But, our hope for this project is that your work would 
        also be integrated into the actual OpenStack mainline -- exciting! This means you would gain 
        development expertise within a large open source project, and would be a great way to 
        demonstrate that you can take research and integrate it
        into a real system.</p>
        <p>For more information about TPMs, there's a <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/summit-videos/presentation/using-tpms-for-the-benefit-of-the-entire-cloud">talk from OpenStack Summit 2015</a> that may
        be helpful.</p>
